# ErgoNames Docs

ErgoNames is a decentralized name system built for the Ergo blockchain. By utilizing NFT technology, our system can create "human-readable" and "easy-to-remember" addresses for users. We aim to make the user experience when operating on Ergo much easier. The ErgoName system acts as the "middleman" between the users and wallet/dapps. The difference between our system and traditional DNS systems is that ErgoNames are completely controlled by the owner.

The system is comprised of three parts:

1. Backend
2. Smart Contracts
3. SDKs

In this documentation, you will find everything you need to start using ErgoNames, as an end-user or as a developer.
