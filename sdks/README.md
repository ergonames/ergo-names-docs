We have created 4 different SDKs for interacting with our system. Each SDK has the same function and uses the same datapoints.

All of the SDK functions can be found [here](functions.md)

### SDK List

[JavaScript](javascript.md)

[Rust](rust.md)

[Python](python.md)

### SDKs Coming Soon

- Scala

### How It Works

The SDKs make calls to the public explorer [API endpoints](https://api.ergoplatform.com/api/v1/docs/)

The endpoints include:

- api/v1/tokens/search
- api/v1/boxes
- api/v1/assets/search/byTokenId
